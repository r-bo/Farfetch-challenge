Task 1 - standalone page

Notes - I used a different font for the nav bar and content as the name of the font used in the design was unknown.

Development stack - HTML/CSS/Javascript

My approach was to create a lightweight page, mobile-first design with media queries targeting larger screen sizes. I used simple Javascript for optimal perfomance (toggle switches for the mobile nav and search functions), and used a couple of CSS animations for the nav and CTA to give it a interactive/tactile feel when used.

I used flexbox in the header sections to keep everything aligned for mobile and desktop view.
